# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 🧬 From Medical Data to Meaningful Insights
This project explores the **Diabetes dataset** to uncover insights about health indicators, disease likelihood, and contributing factors.  
The complete process includes **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using Python, and building multiple **machine learning models** for prediction and evaluation.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
- **Objective:** Analyze patient health metrics to understand trends in glucose levels, BMI, pregnancies, and other factors that affect diabetes risk.  
- **Goal:** Transform raw medical data into actionable insights and build predictive ML models that can assist early diabetes detection.

## 🗝️ Key Steps

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Replaced invalid zero values (common in medical datasets).  
- Imputed missing values using median.  
- Scaled numerical features using *StandardScaler*.  
- Prepared train/test splits for ML modeling.

---

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized diabetes distribution (0 = No, 1 = Yes).  
- Plotted histograms for major health indicators: Glucose, BMI, Age, Blood Pressure, Insulin.  
- Generated correlation heatmap to highlight strongest predictors.  
- Compared diabetics vs non-diabetics using boxplots.

---

### 3. **Building ML Models**
Models implemented and compared:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- XGBoost Classifier  

Evaluation metrics used:
- Confusion Matrix  
- Accuracy Score  
- Classification Report  
- ROC-AUC Curve  

---

### 4. **Model Evaluation Visualizations**
- Confusion matrices for all models  
- ROC curve comparison  
- Model accuracy comparison bar chart (with numerical values on top)

---

## 🔍 Insights
- **Glucose**, **BMI**, and **Age** are the strongest predictors of diabetes.  
- Higher glucose values correlate highly with diabetes risk.  
- Data cleaning significantly improved model accuracy.

---
## 🎯 Overall Benefit of These ML Models
- **They help us**:
  
**✔ Detect diabetes early**

so patients can get treatment sooner.

**✔ Reduce medical testing costs**

If model predicts low risk → avoid unnecessary expensive tests

**✔ Support doctors with data-driven insights**

Doctors get probability scores, not just yes/no.

**✔ Improve healthcare planning**

Hospitals can identify high-risk patient groups.
